  I believe an imij becomes a story when the artist is bold enough to take a
  chance. That moment when the urge to move overpowers the "WILL" to remain
  safe. So whether it's a camera, paint brush, keyboard or dancing shoes ... the
  risk is the greatest when you finally make it to the edge. That moment when
  your head tells your heart that this isn't just crazy it's flat out stupid to
  move on. Your toes tingling over the edge of what you consider safe. Your
  inner voice betraying you as it sides with that of public oppinion shouting,
  "turn back before you make a fool of yourself". Most of us give in and give up
  - never taking that next step. What we don't realize is that when we feel like
  it's time to quite, we are actually never going to be closer to our next
  success. This success, however, is often hidden under the cloak of failure.
  Our purpose in life isn't about what we can do (that's easy) ... rather it's
  about what we are willing to endure - so that we may catch a glimpse of what
  our true character looks like. My name is Paxton Helling and welcome to imij.
