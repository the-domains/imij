Image /imij/ . . . it's about perspective.

I believe perspective is the art of seeing what is invisible to others. As a storyteller, I have always been easily charmed by those who spin a refreshing tale. To say it simply. I love story. And we all have an opulent story to tell. What amazes me is how story can be revealed in countless ways, yet, at its core . . . story remains so simple. And it's in that simple-complexity that I find a nudging at my core. A sense of familiar connection, a bond, a point of contact, a reminder of my own personal narrative. I often find myself getting lost in the worlds of those around me. The stories that others tell. The stories bound in books, dance, paintings or drawings. 

These become the 'covers' to the hidden treasures we keep sacred. These tales that one day become the signs we hold high saying, "Hey, here I am . . . and here is my story."

It fascinates me that at we are all highly creative when we enter this world. What I mean is that we all take to art long before any other forms of communication. This is true because we need to "learn" to write. We need to learn how to put the 26 symbols of the alphabet together. And what saddens me is that our intelligence is, most often, judged upon how well our brains are able to do this. I'm referring to the academic institutions of higher learning.

However . . . I am hear (here) to offer another perspective. 

A quick look at the refrigerator door and it becomes apparent that a two year old child is profoundly expressive. We celebrate these works of art like they are a triumphant blade that strikes us right in the heart. We honor these crayon scribbles because they are an innate part of the human connection. I appreciate those young hands and the amazing souls who CHOOSE to 'color' outside the lines. 

They are honest. Simple. Pure.

I believe a waxy crayola-crayon and a plain, white sheet of paper are all that are needed to bring out the child-like emotions in all of us. To me this IS the true nature of STORY.

So . . . I am on a journey that is rooted in connection. A real and tangible experience that allows us all to go back to the day when our small voice was proudly displayed on that refrigerator door. A time when our hearts were held by magnets as we were free to share with the world our amazing . . . imagination.

This site will be a continuous work in progress. I will update often with not only stories I tell, but also from those that inspire me as I choose to celebrate story in all its forms.

Join me as I offer my perspective while I long to learn for what it is that you see.

Love, pax
