Image /'imij/ . . . it's about perspective.

I believe perspective is the art of seeing what is invisible to others. As a storyteller, I have always been easily charmed by those who spin a refreshing tale. To say it simply. I love story. And we all have an opulent story to tell. What amazes me is how story can be revealed in countless ways, yet, at its core . . . story remains so simple. And it's in that simple-complexity that I find a nudging at my core. A sense of familiar connection, a bond, a point of contact, a reminder of my own personal narrative. I often find myself getting lost in the worlds of those around me. The stories that others tell. The stories bound in books, dance, paintings or drawings. These are the signs we hold high saying, "Hey, here I am. Here is my story." It's funny, kind of, that we are all creative when we enter this world. What I mean is that we all take to art long before any other form of communication. A quick look at the refrigerator door and it becomes apparent that a two year old child is profoundly expressive.

Honest. Simple. Pure.

A crayon and a plain white sheet of paper are all that are needed to bring out the child-like emotions in all of us. To me this IS the true nature of STORY.

So . . . I am on a journey that is rooted in connection. A real and tangible experience that allows us all to go back to the day when our small voice was proudly displayed on that refrigerator door. A time when our hearts were held by magnets giving us a place to show the world our imagination.

This site will be a continuous work in progress. I will update often with not only stories I tell, but also from those that inspire me as I choose to celebrate story in all its forms.
