What do I say?

Words are often easy for me to find, because I spend most of my days thinking about stories. This is, of course, between my day to day duties of work and family. I say this, because, I do think of stories often ... and in those stories I find a familiar narrative that seems to connect all of God's amazing creations. So what is that common thread of narration? Struggle! Simple \_ run of the mill ... struggle. I'm not talking about complete and utter hardship ... or am i? It all seems to be so relative. I mean ... really ... what is the classification for one person's struggle to be "harder" than someone else? I suppose it all depends upon the emotion and the immediate experience of it all. Hurt matters the most when it happens to YOU! Otherwise it's just the idea of hurt and we are somehow removed from the real torture and pain that is caused by loss or misfortune..

So how does this abstractness relate to the "Great Horned Owl?' Well ... it is ironic ... I mean the owl is considered the wisest of them all. And now that I say that out loud ... it all makes perfect sense. Like the fine sound of a tuned guitar - it is quite easy to HEAR the sounds of nature ... TUNED ... to perfection.

Those subtle lessons woven into the evening echos when the sun lowers its gaze. The reporting scratch of cricket's legs, sounding the call ... or the great owl asking the question as we are all in need of the answer.

WHO?

As if to say ... "who are you?" "who are we?"

WHO ... WHO ...

A wise question indeed. It's simple ... It's to the point and it's open to interpretation. Thank you ... MR. Owl for never growing tired as you push me to answer your question.

Tonight ... was a great night as I moved closer to that answer ... to that question that Mr. Owl has persistently been asking.

For me the answer to his question is a firm YES! YES ... Mr. Owl ... I do have the ability to persist, endure and conquer. It doesn't' matter so much the degree of suffering ... rather it matters the degree to which we are willing to both quietly and humbly overcome such obstacles. Such trials that are littered like gold along our path in life.

I say this because, Mr. Owl paid me a visit tonight ... literally! And I was more than touched by his willingness to show up.

You "SEE" an owl relies almost exclusively on his ability to ... well ... see. His vision isn't limited to the orientation needed for him to leave the ground as he takes flight ... no way ... he needs that stereoscopic amazingness to SEE his future as well as his next meal. Ya ... he needs not one ... but TWO forward facing HD eyes to get a 3D look of the world around him. This is his advantage because this allows him to SEE what others simply can NOT.

BUT ...

What if this advantage was limited.

Limited because one of those amazing eyes he needs to see was ... blind?

Surely he would perish rather quickly, because, he would be disadvantaged and the others ... those owls with both eye's working in perfect 3D boldness would out compete him and he would lose.

I learned ... tonight ... this is a lie.

And as I gazed back into Mr. Owl's EYE ... I SAW that life isn't about excuses ... why? ... because excuses are nothing more than our justifications to make 'giving up' a forgivable offence. And as I watched this amazing creature stand firm as other 'birds' harassed him ... I finally understood what it means to be humbly amazing when others are beating you down and how to be strong when not a soul is watching.

Tonight was different Mr. Owl ... because I was watching ... I could see your humble 'stoicness' and the ripples of your steadfastness will stay will me for all my days.

Thank you Mr. Owl! I am grateful to you. Why? Because you have peacefully survived even though you are blind! You have done the impossible ... and ... until tonight ... maybe no one in this world has ever noticed ... Well I noticed and you have made a difference. Thank You!

much love friends ... may you take from this story and these photo's something that will be the difference in your life as you move past your limits with grace, power and a sense of humility that what you do is never contingent upon another person's opinion of you. What I mean is that these other 'birds' may hate this owl ... but he remains unaffected ... WhY? because he knows exactly "WHO" he is.

Let's live like that, my friends. Let's live it that greatness.

love,  
pax and Mr. Owl...
